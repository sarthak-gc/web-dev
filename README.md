# Web Development

This repository will document my journey from beginner to intermediate full-stack web development. It will cover both foundational and advanced topics in backend, frontend, DevOps, and project development. The journey will be structured into a 0-1 syllabus for learning core concepts and a 1-100 syllabus for diving into advanced topics, including system design, scaling, and deployment.

## Source

This learning path will be built from various resources, including **Harkirat's cohort** (referenced at [Harkirat's ClassX](https://harkirat.classx.co.in/new-courses/8-live-0-100-complete)), personal experimentation, and various open-source projects.

## Roadmap to Learning Full-Stack Web Development

This repository is split into two major phases:

- **Phase 1: 0-1 Syllabus (Foundational Development)**
- **Phase 2: 1-100 Syllabus (Advanced Development)**

Each phase is further broken down by week, with topics and resources that align with that week's focus.

---

## Phase 1: 0-1 Syllabus (Foundation)

This phase is focused on building the fundamental knowledge of full-stack development, starting with JavaScript basics and diving into backend and frontend technologies.

### Week 1-2: Foundation

- **JavaScript Basics**: Variables, functions, loops, and conditionals.
- **Async Nature of JavaScript**: Callbacks, Promises, async/await.
- **Node.js and its Runtime**: Understanding Node.js and how it works.
- **Databases (NoSQL/SQL)**: Introduction to databases, differences between SQL and NoSQL.
- **MongoDB & Postgres**: Deep dive into MongoDB (NoSQL) and Postgres (SQL).
- **TypeScript Basics**: Introduction to static typing in JavaScript.

### Week 3-4: Backend Development

- **Backend Communication Protocols**: HTTP, WebSockets, gRPC.
- **Express.js**: Basic to advanced routing, middleware, error handling.
- **ORMs**: Working with Object-Relational Mapping tools (e.g., Sequelize, Mongoose).
- **Middlewares, Routes, Status Codes**: Advanced Express concepts.
- **Zod**: Schema validation for TypeScript and JavaScript.
- **MonoRepos**: Introduction to monorepos and TurboRepo.
- **Serverless Backends**: Exploring serverless architecture using AWS Lambda.
- **OpenAPI Specification**: Writing and consuming APIs with OpenAPI.
- **Autogenerated Clients**: Using tools to generate API clients.

### Week 5-6: Authentication & Scaling

- **Authentication with External Libraries**: Passport.js, JWT, OAuth2.
- **Scaling Node.js**: Performance benchmarks, clustering, and load balancing.
- **Deploying npm Packages**: Introduction to publishing and versioning npm packages.

---

## Phase 2: 1-100 Syllabus (Advanced Topics)

In this phase, the focus shifts to advanced backend, frontend, DevOps practices, and system design. These are the topics required to handle complex, large-scale applications and systems.

### Week 7-8: Advanced Backend & System Design

- **Advanced Backend Communication**: Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka), Pub/Sub systems.
- **Proxies and Load Balancers**: High availability, reverse proxies, and scaling techniques.
- **Redis**: Deep dive into Redis for caching and session management.
- **Kafka**: Understanding Kafka for real-time messaging and event streaming.
- **Common Design Patterns in JS**: Singleton, Factory, Strategy, etc.
- **Advanced DB Concepts**: Indexing, normalization, and query optimization.
- **Rate Limiting and Captchas**: Implementing security measures.
- **Sharding, Replication, Resiliency**: Scaling databases and systems.
- **Horizontal and Vertical Scaling**: Techniques for scaling backend systems.
- **Polling and WebSockets**: Real-time communication strategies.
- **GRPC**: Introduction to gRPC and its use cases.
- **Capacity Estimation**: Understanding how to estimate system capacity.
- **Testing Node.js Apps**: Best practices and tools for testing.
- **WebRTC Basics**: Introduction to real-time communication using WebRTC.

### Week 9-10: Advanced DevOps

- **Container Orchestration**: Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automating deployment with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
- **Monitoring Systems**: Prometheus, Grafana, and New Relic for monitoring.
- **Serverless Deep Dive**: Advanced serverless techniques with AWS.
- **AWS Constructs**: Understanding key AWS services (EC2, S3, EKS, Lambda, etc.).

- **GSoC Project Setup and Issue Solving**: Contributing to Google Summer of Code projects and open-source contributions.
- **Building Paytm/Wallet Application**: End-to-end development of a wallet app, including payment gateways, user authentication, and transaction history.

### Week 15-18: Real-World Applications

- **Zerodha End-to-End**: Building a stock trading platform like Zerodha.
- **Zapier Clone**: Rebuilding a Zapier-like automation platform.
- **Real-World Open Source Projects**: Contributing to open-source projects and learning from real-world codebases.
